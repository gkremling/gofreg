Description: The package provides statistical methods to check if a chosen model family fits to given data
  in the context of parametric regression. The model family contains parametric conditional density 
  functions and the data consists of a response variable (Y) and a vector of covariates (X). Different 
  test statistics can be used to verify the validity of the assumed model. The corresponding p-values
  are determined using a parametric bootstrap method.
