## Typical usage

1. Generate or load a dataset
2. Fit a parametric regression model to the given data
3. Compute the p-value of the fitted model using one of the available test 
statistics

## Example

In this example, we will fit a generalized linear model (GLM) to an artificially
created dataset. It consists of two covariates, one of them normally and the 
other one uniformly distributed, and the response variable following a classical
linear model with normal distribution.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
n  <- 100
x <- cbind(rnorm(n, mean = 3), runif(n, min = 1, max = 10))
model_true <- GLM.new(distr = "normal", linkinv = identity)
params_true <- list(beta = c(2, 6), sd = 1)
y <- model_true$sample_yx(x, params_true)
data <- dplyr::tibble(x = x, y = y)
```

First, we fit the correct model to the data.

``` {r}
model_test <- GLM.new(distr = "normal", linkinv = identity)
model_test$fit(data, params_init = list(beta = c(1,1), sd = 5), inplace = TRUE)
print(model_test$get_params())
```

The parameters estimates are very close to the true values. To assess whether 
the fitted model fits to the given data, we perform a bootstrap-based 
goodness-of-fit test using the conditional Kolmogorov test statistic for the 
marginal distribution of Y. 

``` {r}
gt <- GOFTest$new(data = data, model_fitted = model_test, 
                  test_stat = CondKolmY$new(), nboot = 100)
print(gt$get_pvalue())
```

As we would expect, the p-value is rather high, so the model is not rejected.
Next, we will fit a wrong model to the data. In particular, we exclude the 
second covariate.

``` {r}
model_test <- GLM.new(distr = "normal", linkinv = identity)
data_miss <- tibble::tibble(x = data$x[,1], y = data$y)
model_test$fit(data_miss, params_init = list(beta = c(2), sd = 2), 
               inplace = TRUE)
print(model_test$get_params())
```

It can be seen that the variance was estimated to be rather high which is 
reasonable as it includes the part of the variance that could be explained when
taking the second covariate into account. The corresponding 
p-value is computed in the following code chunk.

``` {r}
gt2 <- GOFTest$new(data = data_miss, model_fitted = model_test, 
                  test_stat = CondKolmY$new(), nboot = 100)
print(gt2$get_pvalue())
```

As the p-value is very low, the model hypothesis should be rejected. So the test
reveals the mistake in the model assumption. To further investigate the 
discrepancy, we could look at the plots of the processes underlying the test
statistic.

```{r}
gt2$plot_procs()
```

It can be seen that the original process (red line) behaves very differently
than its bootstrap versions (gray lines). For comparison purposes, we also plot 
the processes in case the correct model was fitted.

```{r}
gt$plot_procs()
```

This time, the original process (red line) behaves very similar to its bootrap 
versions (gray lines). It does not show any more extreme behavior.

## Parametric Regression Models

Here is a list of parametric regression models that are available in the 
`gofreg` package: 

* `NormalGLM`: Generalized linear model with normal distribution
* `GammaGLM`: Generalized linear model with gamma distribution
* `ExpGLM`: Generalized linear model with exponential distribution
* `WeibullGLM`: Generalized linear model with Weibull distribution
* `NegBinomGLM`: Generalized linear model with negative binomial distribution

The package also offers the option to use other user-defined models. For 
instructions on how to implement new models see `vignette("New-Models")`.

## Test Statistics

Here is a list of test statistics that are available in the `gofreg` package:

* `CondKolmXY`: Conditional Kolmogorov of the joint distribution of $(X,Y)$ 
defined in Andrews (1997) [doi:10.2307/2171880](https://doi.org/10.2307/2171880)
* `SICM`: Simulated integrated conditional moment test defined in Bierens & 
Wang (2012) [doi:10.1017/S0266466611000168](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266466611000168)
* `MEP`: Marked Empirical Process defined in Dikta & Scheer (2021) 
[doi:10.1007/978-3-030-73480-0](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-73480-0)
* `CondKolmY`: Conditional Kolmogorov of the marginal distribution of $Y$ 
defined in Kremling & Dikta (2024) [arXiv:2409.20262](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20262)
<!-- * `CondKolmbXY`: Conditional Kolmogorov of the joint distribution of $(\beta^T X, Y)$ -->

The package also offers the option to use other user-defined test statistics. 
For instructions on how to implement new test statistics see
`vignette("New-TestStatistics")`.

## Censored data

The package can also be used to fit parametric regression models and perform 
goodnes-of-fit tests for randmly right-censored survival times $Y$. In this 
case, the `loglik` and `resample` arguments in the `ParamRegrModel$fit()` and
`GOFTest$new()` methods have to be specified. Moreover, the `data` object needs
to be a `data.frame()` with tags "x", "z" and "delta" with $X$ representing the
covariates, $Z = \min(Y, C)$ the censored times and $\delta = 1_{\{Y \le C\}}$ 
the censoring indicators. A test statistic for the censored setting is given by
`CondKolmY_RCM`.

Here is an example with artificial data generated from a normal GLM with 
normally distributed censoring times.

``` {r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
set.seed(123)
```

``` {r}
n <- 100
x <- cbind(runif(n), rbinom(n, 1, 0.5))
model <- NormalGLM$new()
y <- model$sample_yx(x, params = list(beta = c(2, 3), sd = 1))
c <- rnorm(n, mean(y) * 1.2, sd(y) * 0.5)
data <- dplyr::tibble(x = x, z = pmin(y, c), delta = as.numeric(y <= c))

model$fit(data, params_init = list(beta = c(1, 1), sd = 3), inplace = TRUE, 
          loglik = loglik_xzd)
print(model$get_params())
```

It can be seen that the estimated parameters are close to the true parameters
$\beta = (2,3)$ and $\sigma = 1$. Now, we compute the corresponding p-value
using the Conditional Kolmogorov test statistic for the marginal distribution
of $Y$ under random censorship.

``` {r}
gt <- GOFTest$new(
  data = data, model_fitted = model, test_stat = CondKolmY_RCM$new(), 
  nboot = 100, resample = resample_param_cens, loglik = loglik_xzd
)
print(gt$get_pvalue())
```

The p-value is rather high and the model is not rejected which is expected since
we fitted the correct model.
